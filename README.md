## Installation
Clone the github repo, this is only a back-end API.

## Usage
As this is only an API, users wanting to test routes can use an application such as Insomnia or Postman to mimic a client-side action such as creating an account or sharing thoughts. Or build the front-end yourself and test your ability to connect a webpage and make API requests and use the returned data.
